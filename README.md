# 🌐 Full Stack DevOps Challenge

## 📘 Project Overview

This repository contains a full-stack web application built with **React (Frontend)** and **Node.js (Backend)**, containerized using **Docker**, and designed for **DevOps implementation and cloud deployment**.
The project architecture simulates a real-world enterprise environment — including CI/CD, security scans, infrastructure automation, and monitoring.

However, the project contains a few **intentional misconfigurations and hidden challenges** that interns must identify and fix to ensure smooth execution and deployment.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Your goal is to:

* Debug and fix existing configuration issues.
* Containerize and orchestrate the full stack.
* Deploy the complete system on **AWS (Free Tier only)** using best DevOps practices.
* Ensure end-to-end connectivity and performance of all services.

---

## 🧩 Error Challenge Scope

This project intentionally includes **multiple setup and configuration issues** across:

* Backend
* Frontend
* Docker
* Terraform
* Security and CI/CD scripts

Your task is to:

1. **Identify** the issues.
2. **Fix and document** the solutions.
3. **Deploy** the entire stack successfully on AWS Free Tier.

> 💬 Note: The same project was developed on **Azure**, but your challenge is to **recreate and deploy it on AWS** using similar architecture and services available in the free tier.
